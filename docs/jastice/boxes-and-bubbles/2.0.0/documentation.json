    "comment": " The interface for the Boxes and Bubbles physics engine.\n\n# Concepts\n\n## Simulation\n\nBoxes and Bubbles implements a very simple physics simulation. It updates a list of bodies\nat each step. There is no time-normalized integration - if you run it with higher fps, \nit will run faster.\n\nSee the [example code](https://github.com/jastice/boxes-and-bubbles/blob/master/Example.elm) \nand the [example animation](http://jastice.github.io/boxes-and-bubbles/) that it produces\nfor a working usage example.\n\n## Bodies\n\nEverything in Boxes and Bubbles is a Body. A Body is a Box, or a Bubble.\n\nBodies have some properties:\n\n* `position` -- reference point and center of body\n* `velocity` -- direction and speed of movement\n* `mass` -- the mass (stored as inverseMass)\n* `restitution` -- bounciness factor: how much force is preserved on collisions\n* `shape` -- radius for Bubble, extents for Box, wrapped in an ADT.\n\nBodies can have infinite mass. Infinite mass bodies are not affected by any forces.\n\n## Forces\n\nTwo types of global forces: gravity and ambient. Both are vectors,\nso that they could point in any direction. Both can vary over time.\nAmbient force takes the mass of objects into account, while gravity does not.\n\n# Functions\n\n## Constructors and helpers\n\n@docs bubble, box, bounds\n\n## Running the simulation\n\n@docs step, run\n\n",
