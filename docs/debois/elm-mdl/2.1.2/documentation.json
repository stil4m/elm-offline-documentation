A\nminimal example using this library in plain TEA can be found\n  [here](https://github.com/debois/elm-mdl/blob/master/examples/Component-TEA.elm).\n\nUsing more than a few component in plain TEA is  unwieldy because of the large\namount of boilerplate one has to write. This library provides the \"component \nsupport\" for getting rid of most of that boilerplate. A minimal example using\ncomponent support is\n[here](http://github.com/debois/elm-mdl/blob/master/examples/Component.elm).\n\nIt is important to note that component support lives __within__ TEA; \nit is not an alternative architecture. \n\n# Getting started\n\nThe easiest way to get started is to start with one of the minimal examples above.\nWe recommend going with the one that uses \n[the one that uses](http://github.com/debois/elm-mdl/blob/master/examples/Component.elm)\nthe library's component support rather than working directly in plain Elm\nArchitecture.\n\n# Interfacing with CSS\n\nThis library depends on the CSS part of Google's Material Design Lite. Your app\nwill have to load that. See the\n[Scheme](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/debois/elm-mdl/latest/Material-Scheme)\nmodule for details. (The starting point implementations above\nload CSS automatically.)\n\nThe view function of most components has this signature: \n\n    view : Signal.Address -> Model -> List Style -> Html \n\nThe address is standard, and `Model` is just the model type of the component. \nThe third argument, `List Style`, is a mechanism for you to specify additional\nclasses and CSS for the component. You need this, e.g., when you want to\nspecify the width of a button. See the\n[Style](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/debois/elm-mdl/latest/Material-Style)\nmodule for details. \n\nMaterial Design defines a color palette. The \n[Color](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/debois/elm-mdl/latest/Material-Color)\nmodule contains various `Style` values and helper functions for working with\nthis color palette.\n\n\n\n# Component Support\n\nThis module contains only convenience functions for working with nested \ncomponents in the Elm architecture. A minimal example using this library\nwith component support can be found \n[here](http://github.com/debois/elm-mdl/blob/master/examples/Component.elm).\nWe encourage you to use the library in this fashion.\n\nAll examples in this subsection is from the \n[above minimal example](http://github.com/debois/elm-mdl/blob/master/examples/Component.elm)\n\nHere is how you use component support in general.  First, boilerplate. \n\n 1. Include `Material`:\n\n    <!-- MDL -->\n    <link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:400,300,500|Roboto+Mono|Roboto+Condensed:400,700&subset=latin,latin-ext' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons\">\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://code.getmdl.io/1.1.3/material.min.css\" />\n\n 2. Add a model container Material components to your model:\n\n        type alias Model = \n          { ...\n          , mdl : Material.Model    \n          }\n\n        model : Model = \n          { ...\n          , mdl = Material.model\n          }\n\n 3. Add an action for Material components. \n\n        type Action = \n          ...\n          | MDL (Material.Action Action)\n\n 4. Handle that action in your update function as follows:\n\n        update action model = \n          case action of \n            ...\n            MDL action' -> \n              let (mdl', fx) = \n                Material.update MDL action' model.mdl \n              in \n                ( { model | mdl = mdl' } , fx )\n\nNext, make the component instances you need. Do this in the View section of your \nsource file. Let's say you need a textfield for name entry, and you'd like to\nbe notifed whenever the field changes value through your own NameChanged action: \n\n        import Material.Textfield as Textfield\n\n        ...\n\n        type Action = \n          ...\n          | NameChanged String\n\n        ... \n\n        update action model = \n          case action of \n            ...\n            NameChanged name -> \n              -- Do whatever you need to do. \n\n        ...\n\n        nameInput : Textfield.Instance Material.Model Action\n        nameInput = \n          Textfield.instance 2 MDL Textfield.model \n            [ Textfield.fwdInput NameChanged \n            ] \n        \n        view addr model = \n          ...\n          nameInput.view addr model.mdl \n\n\nThe win relative to using plain Elm Architecture is that adding a component\nneither requires you to update your model, your Actions, nor your update function. \n(As in the above example, you will frequently have to update the latter two anyway, \nbut now it's not boilerplate, its \"business logic\".)\n\n\n## Optimising for size\n\nUsing this module will force all elm-mdl components to be built and included in \nyour application. If this is unacceptable, you can custom-build a version of this\nmodule that uses only the components you need. To do so, you need to provide your\nown versions of the type `Model` and the value `model` of the present module. \nUse the corresponding definitions in this module as a starting point \n([source](https://github.com/debois/elm-mdl/blob/master/src/Material.elm)) \nand simply comment out the components you do not need. \n\n@docs Model, model, Action, update\n",

To be \nable to react to some actions of a component, we add to our `container -> \ncontainer` type for actions a potential __observation__ of type `obs`. \nIn practice, this observation type `obs` will be the Action of the TEA\ncomponent __hosting__ MDL components. \n\nAltogether, accounting also for effects, we arrive at the following type. \n",
