The MDL text field component provides various\n> types of text fields, and allows you to add both display and click effects.\n>\n> Text fields are a common feature of most user interfaces, regardless of a\n> site's content or function. Their design and use is therefore an important\n> factor in the overall user experience. See the text field component's\n> [Material  Design specifications page](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/text-fields.html)\n> for details.\n>\n> The enhanced text field component has a more vivid visual look than a standard\n> text field, and may be initially or programmatically disabled. There are three\n> main types of text fields in the text field component, each with its own basic\n> coding requirements. The types are single-line, multi-line, and expandable.\n\nThis implementation provides only single-line.\n\n\n# Configuration\n@docs Kind, Label\n\n# Component\n@docs Action, Model, model, update, view\n",
