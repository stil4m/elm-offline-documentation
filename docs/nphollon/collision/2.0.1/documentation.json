Use `create` to convert the list of faces into a `Bounds` value. Creating the bounds can be time-consuming, so you will want to do this before you start the time loop.\n\n3. If you want to create your bounds ahead of time, you can `encode` them to JSON and `decode` them later.\n\n4. Once your simulation/game is running, test for collisions using `collide`.\n\nThis module will not work for 2D objects.\n\n# Geometry\n@docs Vector, vector, Quaternion, quaternion, axisAngleRotation, Face, face\n\n# Creating Bounds\n@docs Bounds, create, empty\n\n# Checking Collisions\n@docs Body, collide\n\n# Working with JSON\n@docs encode, decode\n",
