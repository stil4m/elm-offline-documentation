This allows `O(log n)` queries for the relative ordering of two elements in a partially ordered set, and `O(log n)` queries for the set of nodes that are reachable from a specific node.\n\nThe downside is that modifying the graph now takes `O(log n * (nodes before this node))` time on average. Modifying the beginning of the graph is thus quite fast, but inserting an edge at the end takes `O(n log n)` time. The other downside is that this optimization only works on directed acyclic graphs.\n",
