    "comment": " Dict.AVL is an alternative Dict implementation backed by an AVL tree rather\nthan a red black tree. It offers much better write performance at the cost of\nmarginally worse deletion performance and about on-par retrieval performance.\n\nIts API is exactly the same as that of the core Dict, with *one* difference:\nchecking for equality. With core's Dict, there is a special case in the `==`\noperator, which we can't use for our Dict. As such, we expose an `eq` function\nthat can be used to check for equality of 2 Dicts.\n\n---\n\nA dictionary mapping unique keys to values. The keys can be any comparable\ntype. This includes `Int`, `Float`, `Time`, `Char`, `String`, and tuples or\nlists of comparable types.\n\nInsert, remove, and query operations all take *O(log n)* time.\n\n# Dictionaries\n@docs Dict\n\n# Build\n@docs empty, singleton, insert, update, remove\n\n# Query\n@docs isEmpty, member, get, size, eq\n\n# Lists\n@docs keys, values, toList, fromList\n\n# Transform\n@docs map, foldl, foldr, filter, partition\n\n# Combine\n@docs union, intersect, diff, merge\n\n",
