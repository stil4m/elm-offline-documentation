[{"name":"Navigation.Router","comment":" This module provides routing for single-page apps based on changes to the\nthe browser's location. To use this module, create a `Navigation.program`\nor `Navigation.programWithFlags` in your main module, and follow the\nprotocols described here to pass state changes (that can possibly change\nthe URL shown in your browser's location bar), and location changes\n(that can either come from your program changing the location, or from\na user typing a new URL into the location bar, following a link, etc.).\n\nRouting happens in both directions\n-- that is, changes to the browser's location are translated to messages\nyour app can respond to, and changes to your app's state are translated to\nchanges in the browser's location. The net effect is to make it possible for\nthe 'back' and 'forward' buttons in the browser to do useful things, and for\nthe state of your app to be partially bookmark-able.\n\nThe router state and protocols in this module are responsible for updating\nthe browser's history and prevent infinite loops that can be could be caused\nif you are both changing the location and responding to location changes.\n\nSee the documentation on the\n[`elm-lang/navigation` package](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/navigation/latest)\nfor a basic discussion of how location changes are passed to a\n`Navigation.program` and how you set up the program to create a `LocationChanged`\nmessage (Note: `LocationChanged` is just a message tag you create; you could\nname it anything you like).\n\nFor a discussion of the\ndifferences between the official module and this one, see the [package documentation]\n(http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/pzingg/elm-navgiation-extra/latest).\n\n# Router State\n\nYour program is responsible for maintaining the state of the `router`, by\nkeeping a `Navigation.Router.Model` member in your program's larger model.\nThis state is used to detect whether incoming changes to your program's location\nare \"internal\" or \"external\".  Call the `Navigation.Router.init` function\nas part of the `init` function in your `Navigation.program`.\n\n@docs Model, init\n\n# Processing Location Changes\n\nYour program's `update` function must update the router's state when\nhandling the `LocationChanged` message, by calling\n`Navigation.Router.locationChanged`.  After updating your program's model,\nthe router can process any additional commands that should be performed\nwhen the URL changes, by calling `Navigation.Router.processLocation`.\n\n@docs locationChanged, processLocation\n\n# Setting Urls Based on Program State\n\nWhen any messages other than a 'LocationChanged' message are received\nby your program's `update` function, you may want changes to your model\nto be reflected in a new URL.  You do this by generating a\n`Navigation.Router.UrlChange` type that indicates what the new URL should\nbe and whether the URL should replace or modify the browser's current history.\n\nYour program's `update` function calls `Navigation.Router.urlChanged` to\nlet the router remember the URL that you are setting, so that when the\nlocation change is received later, an infinite loop is prevented.\n\n@docs UrlChange, HistoryEntry, urlChanged\n","aliases":[{"name":"Model","comment":" Encapsulates the router's state.  A `Navigation.Router.Model` must be\nincluded in your program's larger model.\n\n`reportedUrl` is the last Url reported to us via urlUpdate.\n\n`expectedUrlUpdates` represents how many outstanding commands we've\nsent to change the URL.

In that case, we can\navoid creating a spurious duplicate entry in the browser's history.\n\nThe reason we take a `String` (rather than a more structured type) is that\nthere may be several ways you might want to build up the required URL. We\ndon't want to be prescriptive about that. However, the `String` you provide\nmust follow a couple of rules.\n\n* The `String` must already be uri-encoded.\n\n* The `String` must either start with a '/', a `?' or a '#'.\n\n    * If it starts with a '/', it will be interpreted as a full path, including\n      optional query parameters and hash.\n\n    * If it starts with a '?', then we'll assume that you want the current\n      path to stay the same -- only the query parameters and hash will change.\n\n    * If it starts with a '#', then we'll assume that you want the current\n      path and query parameters (if any) to stay the same -- only the\n      hash will change.\n\nSo, what you should *not* provide is the scheme, host, or authentication\nmethod -- that is, no \"http://elm-lang.org\". You should also not use relative\nURLs. (Let me know if you'd like relative URLs -- we might be able to do\nsomething sensible with them, but we don't yet in this version).\n\nOne way to construct a `UrlChange` in a modular way is to use the\n`RouteUrl.Builder` module.
